# Data-driven alerts

What good are great reports and insights if no one views them consistently? What if there was a way to draw target report users' attention proactively when data events pass a threshold? Leverage the same Power BI artifacts for data-driven alerts. Solliance can create data-driven alerts based on key Power BI measure thresholds. Once a threshold is reached, a notification can be sent out to report users with a link back to the Power BI report. This increases report usage and the likelihood users will take action on organization key performance indicators.
