## Big Data reporting

Integrating, processing, and reporting on big data is a more challenging project compared to other analytical projects. Without proper architecture design, the data volume and velocity can overwhelm poorly designed environments. Data refreshes and report calculations are slow. Solliance has experience developing architecture and sizing infrastructure that can handle big data needs. Whether its batch or streaming data, we help clients ingest, process, and partition data for optimal analytical performance.
