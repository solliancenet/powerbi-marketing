## Data Integrations

Solliance's engineers can develop pipelines to automate your data extraction and transformation tasks, whether your data is stored on-premises, in Azure, or at other cloud providers. Multiple data sources can be transformed into the optimal storage and analytical format, making it ready for reports and machine learning processes. You can implement an end-to-end analytics solution on a single platform. We can solve your difficult integration challenges and let your organization focus on deriving value from the reporting data.

Pipeline completion events do not mean new data has been loaded into your environment successfully. Once are the pipelines operational, Solliance can create post processing data checks. Custom rules will validate your data and send alerts to administrators if data anomalies exist. Don't wait for users to alert you the reports are broken.
