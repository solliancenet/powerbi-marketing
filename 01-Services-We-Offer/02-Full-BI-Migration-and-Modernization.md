Solliance will partner with your organization to implement your end-to-end BI solution. Whether your data lives in Excel spreadsheets, SaaS, or enterprise cloud database providers, we can customize an architecture to migrate/integrate your data into a high performance data serving layer.

Great reports require current data and need to be enhanced to answer new business questions. Your business environment keeps changing and so will your reporting needs. Users need to realize important facts quickly and explore the data for new or hidden insights.

## Migrate from Excel to Power BI

Ready to migrate from Excel to Power BI reports? It depends on your needs. How much data are you processing and what are you report collaboration needs? Excel allows for great dataset definition flexibility and proof of concept (POC) modeling. Once your POC model is complete, consider migrating the data model and visualizations to a scalable BI platform like Power BI. 

As dataset sizes grow and collaboration needs evolve, Power BI can process your data quickly and share reports securely. Processing larger more complex data is no longer constrained by a user's desktop hardware. Automated data refresh schedules make it easy to configure refresh schedules to match your company's needs. Avoid the manual steps for report distribution and collaboration. Free your resources from repetitive low value tasks.

Solliance will migrate your key spreadsheets into central data serving repository using a modern automated workflow. Your report users will have valid fresh data all the time.

## Centralize your data and calculations into a single source of truth

Important organization data can be located in multiple data source locations. Manually exporting and importing data from the application platform into the reporting platform can be time consuming. Power BI makes data ingestion, modeling, and rapid report development easy. With over 90 data provider connectors, Power BI can import data from many of the top data serving platforms on automatic scheduled basis. Bringing the data into a central data repository provides vendor independence and allows users to ask more complex questions across different data domains.

Once your team validates key calculations, make them available to the rest of the organization. Let others create new reports from a known certified dataset. Create and increase the ability for self-service BI solutions and reduce the barrier for a thriving organizational data culture.
