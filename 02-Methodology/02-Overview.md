## Report development methodology

Building a report with appealing visualizations is only a small part of the overall process. What good is a report that does not focus on answering the right question in the first place?

At Solliance, we focus on a holistic approach to creating a report. We will guide your organization through answering preliminary questions like:

1. What are the near term priority business goals, and how are you measuring your performance/progress with data? When you understand the reporting focus, the data source requirements become clear. The data granularity, extraction, and processing requirements rise to the surface.
2. What actions are your users taking after reviewing your reports? Reports provide value measurements of excellence and provide clarity regarding areas of deficiencies. Build reports with the actions users are going to take in mind.
3. Who are the main stakeholders? Why should they care about your report? Even though a report has been developed, the target audience still needs to be invested for adoption to be guaranteed. Great reports require collaboration and should be customized to meet the stakeholders' prioritized use cases. The report design is affected greatly by the stakeholder profile and their needs.
4. Where is the stakeholder most likely to view a report? e.g. Plant floor, desk, on a phone in a car. Target audiences may view their reports in different locations, devices, and formats. These critical requirements affect technology choices and report design.
5. What does project success look like? Each project phase needs a success target. This target will serve as a stopping point to evaluate the current iteration's success.

Implementing a successful BI project entails more than deploying and configuring technology. It is about knowing which organization questions need to be answered and answering the right questions in the report. The organization must believe in and value the report; leadership must review and rely on the same report data. "*Don't expect what you don't inspect.*"
