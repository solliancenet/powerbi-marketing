# Data-driven alerts

What good are great reports and insights if no one uses them consistently? Leverage the same Power BI artifacts for alerts. Solliance can create data-driven alerts based on key Power BI measure thresholds. Once a threshold is reached, a notification can be sent out to report users with a link back to the Power BI report. This increases the likelihood users will take action on organization key performance indicators.
